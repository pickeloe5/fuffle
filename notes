fuffle-else: conditionally render children when:
  previous sibling is fuffle-if, and
  that instance of fuffle-if is falsey.

BindingBase could use some tuning up
  a builder pattern would be nice

when ['array', '0'] is a dependency of a binding
  and ['array'] is wrote
  we should still re-run the binding

fuffle-if should be able operate without a shadow node
  there's also a strong use-case for a component with no template/shadow
