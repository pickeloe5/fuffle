sometimes we want to bind a non-string attribute and use it as a non-string
  the attribute names are already a pain though
  so for now we just check if the binding evaluates to a string
  if it does, apply it directly as the attribute value
  else, show the JS as the attribute value, hiding the real value on the node
  I started using a custom event `fuffle-attribute-changed` to solve this

break iterative rendering out of fuffle-for
