we should ensure we use the DOM lifecycle correctly:
 - when do we add children?
 - when can we expect children to be added?
 - how can we access component methods from element instances?
 - etc.

part of the fuffle-for integration includes checking tag name on Template.js
 - would be nice to have a better check or workaround
